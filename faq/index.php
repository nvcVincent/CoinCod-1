					<h3>What is CoinCod?</h3>
						<p>Coincod is a revolutionary auction concept. The basic idea is to offer brand new products at very attractive prices. Or we rather term it as "UnAffordable To Affordable".</p>
					
					<h3>How does CoinCod work?</h3>
						<p>Every day Coincod sells new branded products at incredibly low prices in auctions. With each placed bid, the price of the auctioned item decreases or increases by 1 cent ($0.01). Once an auction has started and you bid, we reset the countdown back to its limit time. If no-one else bids before the clock has reached countdown, you win the auction item at a bargain price!</p>
						
					<h3>How can I start using CoinCod?</h3>
						<p>You need to register as a user at coincod.com. It will take you 1 minute. After a successful completion you can buy bids on our site and participate in any auctions you wish.</p>
						
					<h3>How do I participate in the auction?</h3>
						<p>In order to participate you need to submit a bid in an ongoing auction. You can either place a bid by sending a text message from your mobile phone or by bidding through a Coincod online account. Creating a Coincod account is easy, simply click on "sign up" and follow the instructions. Once registered, you can upload bids on your account through all channels (e.g. e-banking) that are available.</p>
					
					<h3>There is an auction that ended today and now I see it re-listed. Why?</h3>
						<p>True, there is a possibility that it might happen. This is when the auction winner turns out to be fraudulent - for example someone who has registered multiple accounts in our system without entering any personal data and automatically received free bids for each username created. All bids by such fraud users will be considered void and the auction will be re-listed from the same point when it ended so that real users can have a possibility to win it. Our support team is doing its best on a daily basis to filter such cases.</p>
						
					<h3>Are the products being sold all new?</h3>
						<p>Yes. All products sold are brand new and come from respected manufacturers. All products come with relevant warranties from the factory but not from CoinCod unless its proven it is the fault of CoinCod.</p>
						
					<h3>How much does it cost for me to place a bid?</h3>
						<p>To submit a bid through CoinCod account it costs RM0.30 for one token. We have different amount of token that allows users to buy them at once. </p>

					<h3>I don\'t live in the Malaysia. Can I still participate in CoinCod\'s auctions?</h3>
						<p>Currently the answer is still no. CoinCod is currently open for Malaysian residents only. But we hope to extend the services to other countries soon. Hopefully our users can wait patiently.</p>

					<h3>Is the warranty on the goods that I bid for an win in the auctions?</h3>
						<p>All products come with relevant warranties where applicable. Please read section 5 under our Terms of Services for further details.</p>
 
					<h3>What happens if at a new auction only one bid is being submitted and nobody else raises the bid?</h3>
						<p>The auction closes once the countdown timer reaches 0 (zero) and the product is sold to that single bidder.</p>

					<h3>Can I undo already submitted bids?</h3>
						<p>No. Bids that were placed cannot be undone.</p>

					<h3>Can I bid for the same product more than once?</h3>
						<p>Yes you may. There are no limits to how many times bids can be placed on an auction.</p>
					
					<h3>Can I bid during the night?</h3>
						<p>All auctions are open for 24 hours. The opening time for each auction is specified on the website. Bids can also be bought 24hours everyday.</p>
						
					<h3>How do I know if I am the highest bidder?</h3>
						<p>Your nickname will appear in the item auction box under the highest bidder column.</p>
						
					<h3>How do I know if an auction has ended?</h3>
						<p>The bid button will be replaced with a red "ENDED" button and the countdown will be replaced with "0:00".</p>
						
					<h3>What happens when I win?</h3>
						<p>Each auction ends with a winner. Each winner will be contacted by CoinCod team to arrange for delivery of the won item. The winner needs to pay the end price of the product on auction. Also, the delivery fee will be paid for by the winner. Note: Product cost refers to the final cost of product at which bidding stopped. It is referred on CoinCod as "Current price". It is NOT the retail price of the item.</p>
